What experiments are we going to do?

Goal is to show that our assignment has high fidelity while using less resource.
Or when there is not enough resource -- best possible fidelity.
And experiments to show that our program takes shorter to run.
Also if the demo version does better then an optimized version should do even better.

1. The DDOS one.

2. MaxiNet -- check this.

3. The ones in EmuLab paper.

4. The ones in METIS paper.

## Alternative Approaches

1. Balanced partitioning

2. Partitioning based on CPU share requirement (no capacity)

3. Partitioning based on link bandwidth?
