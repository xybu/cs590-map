# Mapping Network Experiment onto Heterogeneous Clusters

## Intro

## Assumptions

Physical machines in the heterogeneous cluster differ in computational power.

## Input

### Experiment topology.

Stick with Chaco format for now.

### Number of physical machines.

An integer `N`.

### An initial mapping.

```
P1:
h1()

P2:

```

On each physical machine, we run a set of experiments to figure out the
packet processing capacity as a function of CPU share `P_i(CPU share)`.

## Algorithm

## Proof

## Experiments

## Conclusion
