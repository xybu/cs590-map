Visualization
=============

Some scripts for visualizing Chaco graphs and mapping results.

## Chaco Graph Visualization

In a visualization of Chaco graph input, size of node is node weight
(heavier -> bigger) and color of node is degree (higher -> darker).

Edge width reflects edge weight (heavier -> thicker).


## UC-MKL Assignment Visualization

Size of node reflects node degree (higher -> bigger) and node color reflects
which physical machine (PM) it's assigned. Nodes of same color are assigned
on the same PM.

Again, edge width reflects edge weight (heavier -> thicker).
