This is the directory in which the executable image (called "chaco")
is placed by the makefile.  You will also notice some sample input 
files. The "*.graph" files are graph input files, and the "*.coords" 
files have coordinate inputs for geometric partitioning methods. The
correct format for these files is described in detail in the user's
guide, "doc/User_Guide.ps".

The "grid20x20.*" files describe a simple square grid with 400 vertices.
The "film.*" files correspond to a small, two dimensional unstructured
mesh with tetrahedral elements.  A somewhat larger graph is described
by the "hammond.*" files.  It is a 2D finite element grid of a complex
airfoil with triangular elements.

Larger graphs in a chaco input format can be obtained via anonymous ftp
to www.cs.sandia.gov in the directory pub/graphs.
